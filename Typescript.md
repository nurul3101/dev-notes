# Typescript

- Javascript superset
- Building up on javascript, adds new features.
- Cannot be executed by browsers, so typescript needs to be converted into javascript before executing.
- run time errors can be avoided and caught during development
- ts-node allows us to compile typescript into javascript and execute it in the same step.

Type - Easy way to refer to different properties and functions that a value has.

If variable declaration and initialization is one the same line then typescript inference can detect the type.
